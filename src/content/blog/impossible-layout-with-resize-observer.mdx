A few months ago at work I was developing a new feature to improve our users' experience managing their purchases and sales, and I faced some technical challenges imposed by the web platform. In this post I'll share my journey on how I managed to solve this impossible layout using the ResizeObserver API.

## **The Layout**

It consists of two columns: the left one has a list of cards and the right one displays the selected item details with dynamic content, as shown below:

<a href="https://9n47sh.csb.app/layout.html" target="_blank">
  <img
    src="/assets/resize-observer/layout.png"
    alt="Layout of the user interface"
    style="width:100%; margin-bottom: 1rem; border-radius:8px;"
  />
</a>

I quickly notice an issue: if the list is too long and the user scrolls down and selects an item, it appears like nothing has happened on the screen because the card was rendered way up in the document.

    alt="Video showcasing the off-screen card misbehaviour"
    style="width:100%; margin-bottom: 1rem; border-radius:8px;"
  />
</a>

## **Make it sticky**

I fixed this by making the right side sticky, but another issue popped up. If the content was larger than the browser viewport, the user would have to scroll all the way down to see the rest. This was a big problem because there are some action buttons at the bottom that the user woudln't be able to see.

    style="width:100%; margin-bottom: 1rem; border-radius:8px;"
  />
</a>

## **Maybe two scrollbars**

So, I thought, why not have two scrolling areas? But it wasn't very intuitive and, to be honest, the scrollbars made me puke. ðŸ¤®

    alt="Video showcasing the scrollbars approach"
    style="width:100%; margin-bottom: 1rem; border-radius:8px;"
  />
</a>

## **Or fixed buttons**

My next attempt was fixing the action buttons to the bottom, so they were always in sight, but it didn't look good, and users still had to scroll down to see the rest of the content.

<a href="https://9n47sh.csb.app/fixed.html" target="_blank">
  <img
    src="/assets/resize-observer/fixed.webp"
    alt="Video showcasing the fixed buttons approach"
    style="width:100%; margin-bottom: 1rem; border-radius:8px;"
  />
</a>

At this point, I'm not gonna lie, I was pretty upset. I tried different ideas, but none of them worked. So I decided to do some research, and I found this tweet that enlightened me. It was exactly the answer to my problem.

<div style="display:grid; place-items:center;">
  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
      If a position:sticky side-column is taller than the viewport, should its
      bottom part scroll into viewâ€¦
      <br />
      <br />
      A) early, as soon as the user starts scrolling the page
      <br />
      <br />
      B) late, only once the user scrolls to the bottom of the page
      <br />
      <br />
      (browsers do B, convo about A: <a href="https://t.co/SrAw9YOVpq">

      </a>)
    </p>

  </blockquote>
  <script
    async
    src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"
    charset="utf-8"
  ></script>
</div>

Now, I knew that when my side column was larger than the viewport, its bottom part should scroll early, as soon as the user starts scrolling the page.

## **Offset**

To accomplish this, I also knew I needed to calculate the offset, in this case `x`, to add it as a negative top to my container. So the formula would be the container height (`y`) minus the viewport height (`z`).

# **x = y - z**

<img
  src="/assets/resize-observer/offset.png"
  alt="Visual representation of the top offset calculation"
  style="width:100%; margin-bottom: 1rem;"
/>

I had the solution but one last issue still remained: I didn't know the dynamic container height.

## **[ResizeObserver](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ResizeObserver) to the rescue!**

To figure it out, I used this API that allows you to get notified when the size of a given element changes, and it works by passing a callback to the constructor that receives a representation of the element's new size:

```javascript
new ResizeObserver((entries) => {
  // Check the entry is not an empty array.
  const entry = entries.find(Boolean);
  if (entry?.contentRect) {
    // Calculate the top offset subtracting the viewport height
    // minus the observed element height
    const topOffset = Math.min(
      document.documentElement.clientHeight -
        entry.contentRect.height -
        SPACING, // Minus some spacing to make it look nicer
      SPACING
    );
    // Add the top offset to the container element
    entry.target.style.top = `${topOffset}px`;
  }
}).observe(summary); // Start observing the container element
```

## **The result**

With this simple and clean approach, we ensure the user can see the entire content as soon as they start scrolling, and the container stays visible at all times, resulting in a sleek and intuitive UI.
